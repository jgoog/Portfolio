# Project Overview: User Access Management (UAM) Docker Frontend Project

## Project Purpose
This project aims to set up a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions for a User Access Management (UAM) replica project. The CI/CD pipeline will automate the build, testing, and deployment processes, ensuring efficient and reliable delivery of the application. Docker will be used for containerization to create a consistent environment for development, testing, and deployment.

## Users
- **Developers**: Those who will benefit from automated build, testing, and deployment processes.
- **Administrators**: IT administrators who require a streamlined and efficient deployment process.
- **End Users**: Users who will interact with the UAM application for managing access permissions.

## Job it Performs
- Automates the build process to ensure the application is built consistently every time.
- Automates testing to quickly identify and resolve issues.
- Automates deployment to streamline the delivery of the application to various environments.
- Provides a containerized environment for development, testing, and production, ensuring consistency across all stages.

## Inspiration
The inspiration for this project was to simplify and streamline the development and deployment process for a User Access Management application. By leveraging CI/CD and containerization technologies, the project aims to enhance efficiency, reliability, and consistency.

## Key Features
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated build, testing, and deployment using GitHub Actions.
- **Containerization**: Docker used to create consistent environments for development, testing, and production.
- **Angular Frontend**: Modern, responsive frontend built with Angular.
- **Automation**: Reduced manual intervention in the deployment process, leading to faster and more reliable releases.

**Docker Containers**

## Competencies

### JF 4.3
- **Is able to build, manage and deploy code into the relevant environment.**
- **Situation**: For the UAM Docker Frontend project, I was responsible for setting up and managing the CI/CD pipeline, as well as deploying the application.
- **Actions**: 
  - **Build**: Configured the build process for the Angular frontend using GitHub Actions.
  - **Manage**: Utilized Docker to manage the development and testing environments, ensuring consistency across all stages.
  - **Deploy**: Automated the deployment process using GitHub Actions, which streamlined the delivery of the application to various environments.
- **Results**: The automated CI/CD pipeline and containerization resulted in a more efficient and reliable development cycle, with faster build times and consistent deployment environments. This greatly enhanced the projectâ€™s overall productivity and reliability.
- **Connection to Project**: Properly setting up the CI/CD pipeline and using Docker for containerization were essential for the successful build, management, and deployment of the UAM application.

### JF 1.7
- **Can follow company, team, or client approaches to continuous integration, version, and source control.**
- **Situation**: In the UAM Docker Frontend project, maintaining a consistent and reliable codebase was crucial, requiring effective use of version control and continuous integration.
- **Actions**: 
  - **Version Control**: Used Git and GitHub for version control, ensuring all code changes were tracked and managed efficiently.
  - **Continuous Integration**: Implemented continuous integration using GitHub Actions to automatically build and test the application whenever changes were made to the codebase.
  - **Source Control**: Followed best practices for source control, including regular commits, branching strategies, and code reviews to maintain a high-quality codebase.
- **Results**: The use of continuous integration and version control ensured a stable and maintainable codebase, facilitating collaboration and reducing the risk of integration issues. This approach significantly improved the project's quality and reliability.
- **Connection to Project**: Adhering to continuous integration and version control practices was vital for the success of the UAM project, allowing for smooth collaboration and efficient development workflows.
