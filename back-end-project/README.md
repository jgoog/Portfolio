## Project Overview: Task Manager
Project Purpose
The Task Manager is designed to help users efficiently manage their tasks. It provides functionality for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks, ensuring that users can stay organized and on top of their to-do lists. The application also includes features for user authentication and authorization to protect user data and ensure privacy.
- Users
    - General Users: Individuals who need a simple and intuitive way to manage their tasks and to-do lists.
    - Registered Users: Users who sign up to access personalized task management features.
    - Authenticated Users: Users who log in to ensure their data is protected and accessible only by them.   
- Job it Performs
    - Allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks.
    - Enables users to mark tasks as complete
    - Provides a secure login system with hashed and salted passwords.
    - Supports OAuth for secure authentication.
    - Restricts access to task data to authorized users only.
- Inspiration
    - The inspiration for the Task Manager came from the need for a simple yet effective way to manage daily tasks. Many existing task management tools were either too complex or lacked essential features, prompting the creation of a streamlined application that meets basic and advanced task management needs.
- Key Features
    - Task Management: Create, read, update, delete, and mark tasks as complete.
    - User Authentication: Secure login system with hashed and salted passwords.
    - OAuth Integration: Use OAuth for secure authentication.
    - User Registration: Sign-up functionality to grant access to the API.
    - Authorization: Protects API from unauthorized users and restricts data access to authenticated users only.
